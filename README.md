# DiabeticRateMeasurement
The project aims to predict readmission rate and notice readmission causes in order utilize more efficient
resources by providing extra care to high risk patients, hospital ratings will be improved based on lower readmission rate, and this will improve hospital bed occupancy as well. The used dataset represents 10 years (1999-2008) of clinical care at 130 United States hospitals and integrated delivery networks. The prediction is done using logistic regression model since we have binary target variable used in measuring prediction which are YES or NO as readmitted class.
